# hybrid-ml-pneumonia-detection
This project uses a Hybrid Machine Learning approach to detect Pneumonia by combining deep learning on chest X-ray images and a Random Forest classifier on patient symptoms such as fever, cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. Final predictions are made by fusing outputs from both models to improve accuracy.
